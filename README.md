# Work-Project

This project is just something that I am working on that could make work life a little easier. 

The problem is distinguishing the difference between a walk in customer and a customer that has an appointment.  Currently, our system is the telephone game and assuming the person that needs the information will receive it.

With this, I want to be able to have a login that will allow someone to input a key tag number and information so it can display on a separate screen to let people know what customers are appointments.  The front end will be built using React and backend built with MongoDB.  My final goal is to get it to display on a raspberry pi screen while allowing an associate to log appointments from their phone.

Currently do not have the login feature hooked up.  Also, will be working towards adding socket.io
